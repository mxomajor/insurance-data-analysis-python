# # 📊 Medical Insurance Data Analysis
# 
# This beginner-friendly Python project explores how different factors affect medical insurance charges using a CSV dataset. We'll use Python basics like **lists**, **loops**, **functions**, and **classes** to find insights.
# 
# ## Objectives:
# - Read and store the CSV data.
# - Analyze average charges by gender.
# - Compare smoking habits and age by gender.
# - Draw conclusions using simple data analysis.

# 🧠 Finding: Charges by Gender
# Average charges for males: $13,956.75
# 
# Average charges for females: $12,569.58
# 
# ✍️ Interpretation:
# This suggests that men are paying more for medical insurance on average compared to women in this dataset. The difference is about $1,387.17.
# 
# 🔎 Possible Reasons:
# Here are a few beginner-level insights you could explore:
# 
# Do more males smoke than females in this dataset?
# Smoking raises medical costs a lot, so that could explain the gap.
# 
# Are males older or have higher BMIs on average?
# Age and BMI also affect charges.

male_smokers = 0

for person in people:
    if person.smoker == "yes":

        else:
            female_smokers += 1

print(f"Male smokers: {male_smokers}")
print(f"Female smokers: {female_smokers}")


# In[30]:


male_ages = [p.age for p in people if p.sex == "male"]
female_ages = [p.age for p in people if p.sex == "female"]

print(f"Average male age: {sum(male_ages)/len(male_ages):.2f}")

# ### 📊 Deeper Gender Analysis
# 
# 
# ### 🚬 Smokers by Gender
# Male smokers: 159
# Female smokers: 115
# 
# This shows that there are more male smokers, which could be one reason why males pay more on average for insurance.
# 
# ### 🎂 Average Age by Gender
# 
# Average male age: 38.92
# Average female age: 39.50
# 
# There’s no major age difference, so age is likely not the main cause of the price gap.
# 
# ### 💡 Conclusion:
# The higher average charge for men might be linked to the higher number of male smokers, not their age.
