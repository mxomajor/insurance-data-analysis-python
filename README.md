# 🩺 Insurance Data Analysis with Python

This project is a beginner-friendly exploration of **insurance data** using core Python concepts. It analyzes how **gender, age, and smoking habits** influence medical insurance charges.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Practice using **lists, loops, classes, and functions** in Python
- Analyze real-world CSV data
- Visualize basic trends in medical charges by gender
- Build a project that’s easy for beginners to understand and build on

## 📊 Key Insights

### 🚬 Smokers by Gender
- Male smokers: 159  
- Female smokers: 115  
> More men smoke, which could contribute to higher charges for males.

### 🎂 Average Age by Gender
- Average male age: 38.92  
- Average female age: 39.50  
> Age is very similar, so it's likely **not** the reason for the price difference.

### 💰 Average Charges by Gender
- Average charges (Male): \$13,956.75  
- Average charges (Female): \$12,569.58  
> This gap might be explained by the higher number of male smokers.
